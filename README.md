# TensorFlow-Websit-
I'm currently studying TensorFlow at https://www.tensorflow.org/ 
But some CSS statics of their websit need to be updated 
For instanece the GitHup link need a HTML blanck window so that users won't need to leave the websit if they want to visit their repositorie
Simple stuff like <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">TensorFlow GitHup </a>
That's it coz they too big to pay attention to some small details
